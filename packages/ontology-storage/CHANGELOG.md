# @party-stack/ontology-storage

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9298a20: Complete the Party Stack V0 offline-first ontology stack.

    - Use scoped native backends and replicas with optimistic actions, durable outboxes,
      retained query data and attachment bytes. Open cached definitions offline and
      report incompatible updates without silently discarding queued actions.
    - Serve multiple ontologies through HTTP, SharedWorker or local clients. Stateful
      realtime capabilities require explicit `enableRealtime`.
    - Acquire authenticated backends from saved Connect connections. Expose local
      `AuthenticationProvider`/`useAuthentication` APIs, sign-out and forget operations,
      and Better Auth external-session integration.
    - Define authorization with `objects`, action/query-function checks and scoped
      `additionalObjects`. Project errors and receipt identities at policy boundaries.
    - Compose generated collection links and component-local singular/list fragments.
      `useFragment` returns `{ data }`; attachment hooks return values directly with
      Suspense. Action attachment parameters accept File/Blob inputs.
    - Follow declared links in native query sources with `related(row("project"), "issues")`,
      including policies and pin graphs. Pins retain full objects and their attachment
      bytes regardless of scalar projections.
    - Manage named download families through ordinary queryable pin collections and
      optimistic commands. Inspect one query per family with per-input status in devtools.
    - Reduce repeated storage/query/delivery work and use copy-on-write memory indexes.

    This is a breaking migration: upgrade related clients, servers and runtimes together.
    TanStack DB/react-db 1.0.0-rc.1.4 require the tracked patches installed by
    `@party-stack/tanstack-db-patches` in each consuming repository. See the repository
    V0 implementation summary, patch inventory and current guides for migration details.

- 92480df: Add Effect-based transactional Tables with portable JavaScript/bigint/Temporal values,
  native SQL / user-space IndexedDB indexes, subset queries, and separate sparse-overlay composition.
  Provide IndexedDB, in-memory, and SQLite/PostgreSQL implementations with a shared conformance contract.
  Add an opt-in Effect library build/TypeScript preset and workspace development tooling.

    Port these experimental packages to ontology-storage, sql-ontology-storage, and
    indexeddb-ontology-storage. Add an ontology-derived object API with generated codecs,
    primary-key derivation, validated scalar paths, definition-drift guards, and native
    transactions. Keep the raw engine under explicit infrastructure exports. Document
    independent attachment-byte and replica-row retention without adding automatic GC.

    Allow storage models to derive codecs directly from ontology IR while retaining
    generated schemas for statically typed models.

- 99f5c47: Consolidate native blob metadata in ontology-storage and remove the separate blobs
  package and unused TanStack metadata collection. Maintain schema-derived attachment
  references with object and replica transactions, distinguish identity retention
  from byte pins, and collect unreferenced staged uploads/metadata after a configurable
  orphan grace. Add scoped file-backed reads and atomic receipt binding with durable
  recovery when local mapping conflicts.

### Patch Changes

- ca220d2: Replace the SQLite ontology attachment coordinator with shared transactional blob
  storage and a common owned backend composition. Remove the sqlite-ontology package.
  Rename durable-object-ontology to durable-object-ontology-storage and consolidate
  its R2 implementation on Alchemy's client, with separate storage bridges and an
  Alchemy constructor/resource example. Verify interrupted write/reader recovery with
  real local Durable Object resets.

    Stream attachment helper transfers over Effect RPC with scoped upload ownership,
    bounded acknowledged chunks, size/sequence validation and cancellation. Support
    source-only backend attachment/query helpers without constructing LiveOntology.
    Keep Effect test aliases from redirecting Vitest worker entry points.
